The steps we need to create chutnee are as follows:-
1. Put choppped coriander leaves in a mixer grinder.
2. With that put pieces of ginger, green chillies, curry leaves, small pieces but a 
   lot of coconut to make it in South Indian style.
3. Also put salt (as per taste), cumin 
   seeds, 2-3 flowers of Garlic, Roasted Chickpeas, Peanuts, a pinch of sugar, curd.
4. Now grind it for 1-2 minutes.
5. Open the lid and pour water (half of the lid).
6. Grind it again but fine.
  Now we will give Tadka to the chuntee:-
1. Take a Tadka pan and pour oil in it.
2. When the oil is hot put mustard seeds in it.
3. When the seeds start popping put 1 teaspoon of Asafetida.
4. Then quickly put 2 strips of curry leaves (if you like curry leaves otherwise 1 stripis also okay)    in the pan.

  YOUR SOUTH INDIAN CHUTNEE IS READY!!!
